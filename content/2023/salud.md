# EduPy 2023 Health and Safety Guidelines

Our attendees' health and safety remain our top priority as we continue to monitor the state of the pandemic and look to venue, local, state, and CDC guidelines to make the best and most informed decisions around onsite safety and requirements. Python has worked hard to be a community that is welcoming to all, including those of us who are immunocompromised, disabled, elderly, have support needs, or are caregivers for children, and those of us who share households with or caretake for people in those groups, so we will be erring on the side of safety for all participants.

EduPy will continue to provide social distancing where possible in the venue. Hand sanitizer will also be available for all attendees. The guidelines implemented for EduPy 2023 are subject to change based on health and safety recommendations at the time of the event. We are committing, however, to only make changes in the direction of greater protections.

## Mask Requirement
Face coverings will not be required of everyone inside the conference venue at EduPy. This is not mandatory by local regulations. 

## Vaccination Requirement
EduPy will not require vaccine verification, neither we will be requiring specific boosters since the availability and timing of boosters has varied so much from place to place. COVID-19 vaccines are effective at protecting people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized, and dying. As with other diseases, you are protected best from COVID-19 when you stay up to date with the recommended vaccines, including locally available boosters.


# Attendance
Individuals should not attend the event if they are COVID-positive, are exhibiting COVID symptoms (as defined by the CDC), or have been exposed, within 7 days prior to the event, to someone who was COVID-positive or showed COVID symptoms.

If you are feeling sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, or test positive for COVID-19, prior to the start of the conference, or on any day of the conference, please contact us and free up your ticket letting other to use the space.

# Travel
Anyone traveling to the event should read and abide by the CDC’s Travel Guidelines for domestic and international travel. We ask that participants respect fellow attendees and do everything possible to ensure an environment that is as safe as possible.

# Hotels
Please review the hotel's health and safety guidelines prior to your arrival:


# Commitment to Compliance
EduPy takes these Health & Safety Guidelines very seriously and will therefore enforce a 3-strike rule. Anyone who violates these guidelines on three separate accounts, such as  disregarding social distancing, is subject to removal from the conference.
